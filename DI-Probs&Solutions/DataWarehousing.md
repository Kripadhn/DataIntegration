Data Warehousing: Data warehousing is the process of collecting and storing data in a central repository. The problem is that data may be stored in different sources, making it difficult to access or analyze.
Solution: Data warehousing solves this problem by collecting and storing data in a central repository, making it easier to access and analyze. Code example in Python to store data in a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy:

python:-

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@localhost/database')

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df.to_sql('table_name', engine)
