Data Transformation: Data transformation is the process of converting data from one format to another. The problem is that the data may have different structures or formats, making it difficult to process or analyze.
Solution: Data transformation solves this problem by converting the data into a consistent format that is easier to process or analyze. Code example in Python to transform data from a CSV file into a Pandas dataframe:

python:

import csv
import pandas as pd

with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    data = [row for row in reader]

df = pd.DataFrame(data[1:], columns=data[0])
print(df)
