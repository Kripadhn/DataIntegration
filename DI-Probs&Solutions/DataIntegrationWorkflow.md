Data Integration Workflow is the process of creating a pipeline for moving, transforming and loading data from multiple sources into a target system, such as a data warehouse or a data lake. The process involves several steps including:

Data Extraction: Retrieving data from various sources, such as databases, applications, and APIs.

Data Transformation: Converting the extracted data into a format that can be used by the target system. This may involve cleaning the data, removing duplicates, and transforming data into a common format.

Data Loading: Loading the transformed data into the target system.

A sample code to implement a data integration workflow in Python is as follows:

python:--
----------------------

import os
import pandas as pd

# Step 1: Data Extraction
data = pd.read_csv("source.csv")

# Step 2: Data Transformation
data = data.dropna()
data = data.drop_duplicates()
data = data.rename(columns={'old_col_name': 'new_col_name'})

# Step 3: Data Loading
data.to_csv(os.path.join("target", "cleaned_data.csv"), index=False)
----------------


This code is just an example, and can be modified and optimized as per the requirements of the project. The important thing is to have a clear understanding of the steps involved in the data integration workflow, and the appropriate tools and techniques to implement them.
