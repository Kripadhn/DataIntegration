Data Mining is the process of discovering hidden patterns, relationships, and knowledge from large amounts of data. It is used to extract useful information from raw data to support decision-making processes in various industries.

A common use-case of data mining is customer segmentation, where businesses aim to understand their customer base better and tailor their marketing efforts to each segment. One algorithm used in data mining for customer segmentation is the k-means clustering algorithm.

Here's an example of k-means clustering in Python:

python:-

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv("customer_data.csv")

# Fit the k-means model
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4)
kmeans.fit(data)

# Predict the cluster for each data point
predictions = kmeans.predict(data)

# Assign the predicted cluster to each data point
data["Cluster"] = predictions

# Group by cluster to see the characteristics of each segment
grouped_data = data.groupby("Cluster").mean()
print(grouped_data)


---------

In this example, the customer data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and the k-means clustering algorithm is applied to it using the KMeans class from scikit-learn. The number of clusters is specified as 4, but this could be adjusted based on the results. The algorithm then assigns a cluster to each data point, and the mean of each cluster is calculated to see the characteristics of each segment.
