Data Matching refers to the process of identifying records in two or more data sources that refer to the same entity, based on one or more common attributes. The main goal of Data Matching is to merge and consolidate duplicate records into a single, accurate representation of the data.

Problem:

Duplicate records can arise in various data sources, causing issues in reporting, analysis, and decision making.
Inconsistent data formats, missing values, and typos can make it challenging to match records accurately.
Solution:
Data Matching can be performed using various algorithms, such as rule-based, deterministic, probabilistic, or machine learning algorithms.

Here's an example of a deterministic Data Matching algorithm in Python using fuzzywuzzy library:

scss:--


import pandas as pd
from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz

def match_records(df1, df2, match_field, threshold=90):
    matched_records = []
    for index1, row1 in df1.iterrows():
        for index2, row2 in df2.iterrows():
            if fuzz.token_set_ratio(row1[match_field], row2[match_field]) >= threshold:
                matched_records.append([index1, index2])
    return matched_records

df1 = pd.read_csv('data_source1.csv')
df2 = pd.read_csv('data_source2.csv')

matches = match_records(df1, df2, 'Name')

print(matches)


----------------

In this example, the function match_records takes two dataframes df1 and df2 and a field name match_field as input. It uses fuzzywuzzy's token_set_ratio function to compare the values in match_field between the two dataframes and returns the indices of the matching records. The threshold for match similarity can be adjusted with the threshold parameter.
