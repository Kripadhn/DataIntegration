Data Consolidation is the process of combining multiple data sources into a single, unified view. This can help organizations to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their data, identify patterns and correlations, and make better-informed decisions.

A common use-case for data consolidation is to merge data from multiple departments within an organization. For example, a retail company may want to consolidate customer data from multiple systems, such as a CRM, Point-of-Sale, and Inventory systems, to create a single view of each customer.

The solution for data consolidation can be achieved through various technologies such as data warehousing, master data management, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

Here is an example code in Python using Pandas library to perform data consolidation of two data sources:

python:--
-----------------

import pandas as pd

# Load data from two sources into dataframes
df1 = pd.read_csv("source1.csv")
df2 = pd.read_csv("source2.csv")

# Merge the two dataframes on common columns
consolidated_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='id')

# Save the consolidated data to a new csv file
consolidated_df.to_csv("consolidated_data.csv", index=False)

------------------

In this example, data from two sources are loaded into separate dataframes df1 and df2. The pd.merge() function is used to merge the two dataframes on a common column 'id'. The consolidated data is then saved to a new csv file.
