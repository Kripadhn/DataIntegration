Data Enrichment is a process of adding additional information to data, to make it more meaningful and useful. A common problem with data is that it often lacks relevant information, making it difficult to draw meaningful insights and make informed decisions. To overcome this challenge, data enrichment involves adding additional data sources or attributes to the existing data set, making it more complete and informative.

The solution to this problem is to identify the missing information and then find appropriate sources to supplement the data set. This can be done through various methods such as web scraping, API calls, or manual data entry.

Here is an example in Python to demonstrate data enrichment:

python:--
-------------

import pandas as pd

# Load the data set
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Add a new column "city" to the data set
df['city'] = ''

# Enrich the data set by adding city information
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    # Get the latitude and longitude from the data set
    lat = row['latitude']
    lng = row['longitude']
    
    # Use an API call to get the city information based on the latitude and longitude
    city = get_city_from_api(lat, lng)
    
    # Update the city information in the data set
    df.at[index, 'city'] = city
    
# Save the enriched data set to a new file
df.to_csv("enriched_data.csv", index=False)
------------------

In this example, the data set is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and a new column "city" is added to it. The data is then enriched by using an API call to get the city information based on the latitude and longitude values in the data set. The enriched data is then saved to a new file.
