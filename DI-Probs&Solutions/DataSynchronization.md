Data Synchronization is the process of maintaining consistency between multiple data sources, such as databases, applications, or files. It ensures that changes made in one source are automatically propagated to the other sources.

Problem: As businesses grow, data is often stored in different systems, leading to inconsistencies between data sources. This can lead to inaccurate reporting, wrong business decisions, and operational inefficiencies.

Solution: Data Synchronization automates the process of maintaining consistency between different data sources, ensuring that data remains up-to-date and accurate in all sources.

Here is an example of Data Synchronization in Python using the SQLAlchemy library:

python:-
---------------
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Table, MetaData

# Connect to the source and target databases
source_engine = create_engine('source_db_url')
target_engine = create_engine('target_db_url')

# Load the metadata of the source database
metadata = MetaData()
source_table = Table('source_table', metadata, autoload=True, autoload_with=source_engine)

# Create the target table if it doesn't exist
target_table = Table('target_table', metadata,
                     Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
                     Column('column1', String),
                     Column('column2', String),
                     Column('column3', String),
                     extend_existing=True)
target_table.create(target_engine, checkfirst=True)

# Copy the data from the source table to the target table
conn = target_engine.connect()
conn.execute(target_table.insert().from_select(
    ['column1', 'column2', 'column3'],
    source_table.select().where(source_table.c.column1 != None)
))
conn.close()
------------------

In this example, the code connects to both the source and target databases, loads the metadata of the source database, and creates the target table if it doesn't exist. Finally, it copies the data from the source table to the target table, excluding any records with a NULL value in column1.
