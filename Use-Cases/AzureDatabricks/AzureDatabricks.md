Azure Databricks is an Apache Spark-based analytics platform that can be used for data engineering, machine learning, and advanced analytics. It provides a unified platform for data integration, processing, and analysis, and is designed to handle big data workloads at scale.

Here are a few real-world use cases where Azure Databricks can be used for data integration:

1. Data Lake Integration: In a data lake integration scenario, Azure Databricks can be used to process and analyze data stored in a data lake. For example, you can use Azure Databricks to process log data stored in a data lake, and perform analytics on the log data to identify patterns and trends.

2. Real-time Data Processing: In a real-time data processing scenario, Azure Databricks can be used to process data in real-time and perform real-time analytics on the data. For example, you can use Azure Databricks to process IoT device data in real-time, and perform real-time analytics on the device data to identify trends and patterns.

3. Batch Data Processing: In a batch data processing scenario, Azure Databricks can be used to process large amounts of data in batches. For example, you can use Azure Databricks to process large amounts of log data and perform analytics on the log data to identify patterns and trends.

This is just a simple example of how you can use Azure Databricks for data integration, and the specific code you need to use will depend on your specific data integration requirements.

1st Example:
Azure Databricks provides a powerful and flexible platform for data integration, processing, and analysis, and is designed to handle big data workloads at scale. If you're new to Azure Databricks, I would recommend checking out the Azure Databricks documentation, which provides comprehensive guidance on how to use the platform for data integration and processing.

2nd Example:
In this example, we are reading data from a real-time source (in this case, a Kafka topic), performing some transformations on the data, and writing the transformed data to a target file in Parquet format. This is just one example of how you can use Azure Databricks for real-time data processing, and the specific code you need to use will depend on your specific data processing requirements.
