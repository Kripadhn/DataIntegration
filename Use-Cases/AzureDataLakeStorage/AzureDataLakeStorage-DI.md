Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) is a cloud-based data lake solution provided by Microsoft Azure. Data lakes are repositories that allow you to store large amounts of structured and unstructured data at any scale, and ADLS provides a secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution for data lake storage.

Here's an example of how you can use Azure Data Lake Storage for data integration in a big data processing scenario:
In this example, we are reading data from a large file stored in ADLS, performing some transformations on the data, and writing the transformed data to a file stored in ADLS. This is just one example of how you can use Azure Data Lake Storage for big data processing, and the specific code you need to use will depend on your specific data processing requirements.
