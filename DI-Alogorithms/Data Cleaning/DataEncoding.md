Data Encoding: Convert categorical data, such as strings or labels, into numerical data, so that it can be processed more easily by machine learning algorithms. This can be done using methods such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, or binary encoding.

Data encoding is the process of converting categorical variables into numerical values, which can then be used as input for machine learning algorithms. Here's an example of how data encoding can be implemented in Python using the pandas library:

This code creates a sample dataframe with two categorical variables, Gender and City. Then, it uses the get_dummies method to perform one-hot encoding on the categorical variables. The resulting dataframe will have new columns for each unique category in the original categorical columns, with binary values indicating the presence or absence of each category. Note that other encoding methods can be used, such as ordinal encoding or label encoding.
