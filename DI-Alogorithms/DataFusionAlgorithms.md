Data Fusion is the process of combining data from multiple sources to create a single, unified representation of the data. There are several algorithms for data fusion, including:

Kalman Filter: A recursive algorithm for estimating the state of a system based on measurement data.
Particle Filter: A Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating the state of a system based on measurement data.
Fuzzy Integration: An approach to data fusion that uses fuzzy logic to combine information from multiple sources.
