Example 1: A fuzzy matching algorithm is used to match records based on a certain level of similarity between fields. Fuzzy matching algorithms use a comparison function such as Levenshtein distance to calculate the similarity between two records. In Python, the FuzzyWuzzy library can be used to implement fuzzy matching:

Example 2: A fuzzy matching algorithm compares two data sets based on a specified set of attributes and returns a match if the attributes are similar, but not necessarily exactly the same.
Here is an example in Python using the FuzzyWuzzy library:
