Kalman Filter: A recursive algorithm for estimating the state of a system based on measurement data.

In this example, the Kalman Filter is implemented as a class in Python. The class has three instance variables: process_noise, measurement_noise, and posterior. The process_noise and measurement_noise represent the uncertainty in the system's state and the measurement data, respectively. The posterior variable is the estimate of the system's state, and the covariance variable is a matrix representing the uncertainty in the estimate. The estimate method updates the estimate of the system's state based on the measurement data.
