The Particle Filter algorithm is a common approach for data fusion and can be used to estimate the state of a system over time. It works by representing the system state as a set of particles, each of which has a position and weight. The algorithm then updates the position of each particle based on a model of the system and the observed data, and resamples the particles to create a new set that better represents the state of the system. The final estimate of the system state is obtained by averaging the position of the particles.

Here's an example of how the Particle Filter algorithm can be implemented in Python:

This code implements a basic version of the Particle Filter algorithm, which can be customized based on the specific requirements of the system being modeled. The motion_model and observation_model functions take in the particles and observations and return the predicted state and updated weights, respectively. The resample_ratio parameter can be used to control the amount of exploration in the algorithm.
