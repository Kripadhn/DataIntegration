Data consolidation is the process of combining data from multiple sources into a single, unified view. This can be achieved through various algorithms and methods, including data merging, data mapping, and data normalization. The choice of algorithm will depend on the specific needs of the data integration project.

Here's an example of data consolidation using Python:

In this example, data from three separate sources is loaded into individual DataFrames. The pd.concat function is used to merge the DataFrames into a single, consolidated DataFrame. Finally, the drop_duplicates function is used to remove any duplicates based on the 'id' column. The consolidated data is then saved to a file for further processing.
