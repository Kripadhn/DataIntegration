Data integration refers to the process of combining data from multiple sources into a single, unified view. The following are the different types of data integration:
1. Batch Integration: This type of integration involves combining data in batch mode at specific time intervals. Batch integration is often used when data volume is high and real-time integration is not necessary.
2. Real-time Integration: This type of integration involves combining data in real-time as it is generated or updated. Real-time integration is often used in financial systems, e-commerce, and other time-sensitive applications.
3. Logical Integration: This type of integration involves creating a virtual view of data from multiple sources without actually physically moving the data. Logical integration is often used when data security and privacy are a concern.
4. Physical Integration: This type of integration involves physically moving data from one source to another and combining it into a single database. Physical integration is often used when data needs to be centralized for analysis or reporting purposes.
5. Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Integration: This type of integration involves extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it into a common format, and loading it into a target database. ETL integration is often used for data warehousing and business intelligence.
6. Enterprise Application Integration (EAI): This type of integration involves connecting various enterprise applications, such as CRM, ERP, and supply chain management, to provide a unified view of data. EAI is often used to improve data flow and collaboration between different business units.
7. Cloud Integration: This type of integration involves combining data from multiple cloud-based sources and making it accessible through a single interface. Cloud integration is often used to consolidate data from different cloud services into a single, unified view.
