Log Analytics Workspace: A Log Analytics workspace is a resource in Azure that provides a single place to collect, store, and analyze data generated by resources in an Azure virtual network.

Log Analytics Query: A Log Analytics query is a way to retrieve data from a Log Analytics workspace. Queries can be written in the Log Analytics query language, which is a subset of SQL.

Log Analytics API: A Log Analytics API is an API that allows you to interact with Log Analytics workspaces programmatically. You can use the API to run Log Analytics queries, retrieve results, and manage workspaces.

Azure Monitor: Azure Monitor is a monitoring service in Azure that provides a single place to monitor Azure resources, applications, and services. Log Analytics workspaces can be used in conjunction with Azure Monitor to collect, store, and analyze log data generated by Azure resources.

Azure Event Hubs: Azure Event Hubs is a managed service for ingesting, processing, and analyzing large streams of data. You can use Event Hubs to collect log data from various sources and send it to a Log Analytics workspace for analysis.
Example code for sending log data to a Log Analytics workspace using Azure Event Hubs:

using Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs;
using System;

class Program
{
    private static EventHubClient eventHubClient;
    private const string EventHubConnectionString = "EVENT_HUB_CONNECTION_STRING";
    private const string EventHubName = "EVENT_HUB_NAME";

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        MainAsync(args).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
    }

    private static async Task MainAsync(string[] args)
    {
        eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(EventHubConnectionString, EventHubName);

        await SendLogData();

        await eventHubClient.CloseAsync();

        Console.WriteLine("Log data has been sent to Log Analytics workspace");
        Console.ReadLine();
    }

    private static async Task SendLogData()
    {
        var logData = "{\"logType\":\"error\",\"message\":\"Error message\"}";
        var data = new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(logData));

        await eventHubClient.SendAsync(data);
    }
}
